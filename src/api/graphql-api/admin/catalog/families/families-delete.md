# Attribute Family — Delete (GraphQL)

Deletes an attribute family. The `id` argument is the family IRI (`/api/admin/catalog/families/{id}`). The mutation returns a snapshot of the deleted family.

Two rules block the delete: the store must always keep at least one family, and a family that any product still belongs to cannot be removed. Reassign or remove those products first.

See the [Attribute Families overview](/api/graphql-api/admin/catalog/families/) for how this menu works.

| Condition | Message |
|-----------|---------|
| Family is the default one | `The default attribute family cannot be deleted.` |
| One or more products still use the family | `Cannot delete — attribute family is in use by N product(s).` |
| Unknown id | `Attribute family not found.` |
