# Delete Email Template

Deletes an email template — the **Delete** row action on the admin
**Marketing → Communications → Email Templates** screen.

New here? Read the [Email Templates overview](/api/graphql-api/admin/marketing/communications/templates/) for what an email template does and how its fields behave.

## Operation

| Operation | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `deleteAdminMarketingTemplate` | Mutation | Delete an email template |

## Details

- Requires an admin Bearer token and the `marketing.communications.email_templates.delete`
  permission.
- Pass the template's IRI as `id`. Use the
  [list](/api/graphql-api/admin/marketing/communications/templates-list) query to
  discover valid ids.

### A template a campaign sends cannot be deleted

Removing it would leave that campaign with nothing to send, so the mutation comes
back with an `errors[]` entry instead. Point the campaign at another template first.

### Confirm success via the absence of `errors`

The delete mutation returns a success acknowledgement, not the deleted template's
data — `adminMarketingTemplate` resolves to `null` on the payload. **Treat a
response with no `errors[]` as a successful delete.** If you need a confirmation
message in the body, use the REST endpoint
(`DELETE /api/admin/marketing/templates/{id}`), which returns
`{ "message": "Email template deleted." }`.

## Input fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `id` | ID | Yes | The template's IRI |
