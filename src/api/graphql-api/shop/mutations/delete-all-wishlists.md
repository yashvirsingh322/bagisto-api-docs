# Delete All Wishlist Items

## About

The `createDeleteAllWishlists` mutation removes all items from the authenticated customer's wishlist at once. Use this mutation to:

- Clear the entire wishlist
- Implement a "Clear All" button on the wishlist page
- Reset the customer's wishlist state

> **Note:** This is an authenticated-only operation. The customer is auto-detected from the Bearer token.

## Authentication

This mutation requires customer authentication:

- **Authenticated customers**: Provide a valid customer authentication token in the `Authorization` header. Obtain this token via the [Customer Login API](/api/graphql-api/shop/mutations/customer-login).

```
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `clientMutationId` | `String` | Optional client-side mutation identifier for tracking. |

> **Note:** No additional input is required. Pass an empty input `{}`.

## Possible Returns

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `deleteAllWishlists.message` | `String!` | Success message confirming deletion. |
| `deleteAllWishlists.deletedCount` | `Int!` | Number of wishlist items that were removed. |

> **Note:** If the customer has no wishlist items, the mutation still succeeds and returns `deletedCount: 0` with the same success message. No error is thrown for an already-empty wishlist.
