# Get Customer Invoice

## About

The `customerInvoice` query retrieves detailed information for a specific invoice by its IRI identifier. Customers can only access invoices from their own orders — requesting another customer's invoice returns a not found error, preventing enumeration attacks. Use this query to:

- Display detailed invoice information
- Show invoice summary with line items and totals
- Track payment state and transaction details
- View tax, shipping, and discount breakdowns
- Display financial details for a specific invoice

## Authentication

This query requires customer authentication:

- **Authenticated customers**: Provide a valid customer authentication token in the `Authorization` header. Obtain this token via the [Customer Login API](/api/graphql-api/shop/mutations/customer-login).

```
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
X-STOREFRONT-KEY: <storefrontKey>
```

  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Customer invoice with ID \"999\" not found.",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],
      "path": ["customerInvoice"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Unauthenticated Request

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Customer is not logged in.",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],
      "path": ["customerInvoice"]

## Use Cases

- Display detailed invoice page in customer account
- Show full financial breakdown of an invoice
- Track payment state and transaction ID
- View tax and shipping details
- Check if invoice email was sent

## Notes

- **Customer isolation:** Invoices are scoped through the order relationship. A customer can only access invoices from their own orders.
- **Read-only:** Only query operations are available. Invoices cannot be modified through this API.
