# Get Customer Order Shipments

## About

The `customerOrderShipments` query retrieves all shipments for a specific customer order identified by its order ID. Customers can only access shipments from their own orders — requesting another customer's shipments returns a not found error, preventing enumeration attacks. Use this query to:

- Display shipment tracking information
- Show shipped items and quantities
- Track shipping status and carrier details
- View tracking numbers and shipping numbers
- Display shipment creation timestamps
- Show item-level shipment details

## Authentication

This query requires customer authentication:

- **Authenticated customers**: Provide a valid customer authentication token in the `Authorization` header. Obtain this token via the [Customer Login API](/api/graphql-api/shop/mutations/customer-login).

```
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
X-STOREFRONT-KEY: <storefrontKey>
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `orderId` | `Int!` | ✅ Yes | The numeric order ID for which to retrieve shipments. |

| `id` | `ID!` | IRI identifier of the shipment. |
| `_id` | `ID!` | Numeric shipment ID. |
| `status` | `String!` | Shipment status: `pending`, `shipped`, `delivered`, `cancelled`. |
| `trackNumber` | `String` | Carrier tracking number. |
| `carrierTitle` | `String` | Carrier name (e.g. `FedEx`, `UPS`, `Standard Post`). |
| `totalQty` | `Int!` | Total quantity of items in the shipment. |

| `items` | `ShipmentItemConnection` | Paginated list of shipment line items. |
| `items.edges.node.id` | `ID!` | IRI identifier of the shipment item. |
| `items.edges.node.name` | `String!` | Product name in the shipment. |
| `items.edges.node.sku` | `String!` | Product SKU. |
| `items.edges.node.qty` | `Int!` | Quantity shipped. |
| `shippingNumber` | `String` | Unique shipping number for the shipment. |
| `totalCount` | `Int!` | Total number of shipments for the order. |

## Error Handling

### Order Not Found

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Customer order with ID \"999\" not found.",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],
      "path": ["customerOrderShipments"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Unauthenticated Request

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Customer is not logged in.",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],
      "path": ["customerOrderShipments"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Invalid Order ID

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Invalid order ID provided.",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],
      "path": ["customerOrderShipments"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Use Cases

- Display shipment tracking page in customer account
- Show tracking numbers and carrier information
- Display shipped items and quantities
- Track shipment status and delivery progress
- Build shipment history timeline
- Show carrier-specific tracking links

## Notes

- **Customer isolation:** A customer can only view shipments from their own orders. Requesting shipments for another customer's order returns a 404, preventing enumeration attacks.
- **Read-only:** Only `GET` operations are available. Shipments cannot be modified through this API.
- **Tracking information:** Tracking numbers are only available for shipments with carrier information.
- **Item-level details:** Each shipment item includes SKU and quantity information for order fulfillment tracking.
