# Product Reviews

## About

The `productReviews` query retrieves a collection of product reviews with filtering and pagination support. Use this query to:

- Display product reviews on product detail pages
- Show review statistics and ratings
- Filter reviews by product, status, and rating
- Build review listing pages with pagination
- Display customer feedback and testimonials
- Calculate average ratings and review counts
- Show pending reviews in admin dashboard
- Implement review sorting and filtering

This query supports full pagination with cursor-based navigation and flexible filtering options for various use cases.

> **Note:** This query only returns reviews that have been **approved by an admin**. Reviews submitted by customers are set to `pending` by default and will not appear in the results until an admin approves them from the admin panel. `pending` and `rejected` reviews are never visible to storefront users.

## Arguments

| `status` | `String` | ❌ No | Filter by review status (`"pending"`, `"approved"`, `"rejected"`). |
| `rating` | `Int` | ❌ No | Filter by rating value (1-5 stars). |
| `first` | `Int` | ❌ No | Number of results to return (forward pagination). Max: 100. |
| `after` | `String` | ❌ No | Pagination cursor for forward navigation. Use with `first`. |
| `last` | `Int` | ❌ No | Number of results for backward pagination. Max: 100. |
| `before` | `String` | ❌ No | Pagination cursor for backward navigation. Use with `last`. |

## Possible Returns

| Field | Type | Description |

| `id` | `ID!` | Unique review API identifier. |
| `_id` | `Int!` | Numeric review ID. |
| `name` | `String!` | Customer name who wrote the review. |
| `title` | `String!` | Review title/headline. |
| `rating` | `Int!` | Star rating (1-5). |
| `comment` | `String!` | Review comment/text. |
| `status` | `String!` | Review approval status (`"pending"`, `"approved"`, `"rejected"`). |
| `createdAt` | `DateTime!` | Review creation timestamp. |
| `updatedAt` | `DateTime!` | Last update timestamp. |
| `pageInfo` | `PageInfo!` | Pagination information. |

| `pageInfo.startCursor` | `String` | Cursor for first item in page. |
| `pageInfo.endCursor` | `String` | Cursor for last item in page. |
| `totalCount` | `Int!` | Total reviews matching filters. |

## Review Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `"pending"` | Awaiting moderation approval |
| `"approved"` | Published and visible on the storefront |
| `"rejected"` | Declined and not published |

## Use Cases

### 1. Product Reviews Page
Use the "By Product ID" example to display all approved reviews for a specific product.

### 2. Admin Review Management
Use the "Filtered by Status" example with `status: "pending"` to show reviews awaiting moderation.

### 3. High-Rated Reviews
Use the "Filtered by Rating" example with `rating: 5` to highlight 5-star reviews.

### 4. Customer Testimonials
Filter by approved status and high rating to display customer testimonials.

### 5. Review Analytics
Use pagination to fetch all reviews for a product and calculate statistics.

## Best Practices

1. **Filter by Status** - Always filter by `status: "approved"` to show only approved reviews to customers
2. **Show Ratings** - Display the rating prominently alongside the review
3. **Use Pagination** - Always implement pagination for better performance
4. **Cache Results** - Cache reviews for better performance as they change infrequently
5. **Sort Reviews** - Display most recent or highest-rated reviews first
6. **Prevent Spam** - Only show approved reviews to maintain quality
7. **Display Author Info** - Show customer name to build trust and authenticity
