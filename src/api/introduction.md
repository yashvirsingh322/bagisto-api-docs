# Introduction

Bagisto provides comprehensive API solutions to help developers integrate and extend the platform's functionality. Whether you're building mobile apps, third-party integrations, or headless commerce solutions, our APIs offer the flexibility and power you need.

Both transports expose the **same** data and behaviour — pick the one that fits how you build. Full CRUD, pagination, and token authentication are available on both; the differences below are what actually set them apart.

These docs describe the latest Bagisto core and how each of its features is exposed through the API. Every endpoint page reflects what the current release of the platform does — the same validation, the same rules and the same events the admin panel and storefront run — so what you read here is what the store itself does.

## GraphQL API

The Bagisto GraphQL API enables flexible, efficient data fetching from a single endpoint. Ideal for:

- **Headless Commerce** - Power modern frontend frameworks
- **Mobile Apps** - Reduce bandwidth with precise data queries
- **Custom Storefronts** - Build unique shopping experiences
- **Composite Screens** - Fetch a whole screen's data in one request

**What sets it apart:**
- Single endpoint for every operation
- Fetch exactly the fields you need — no over- or under-fetching
- Related data (product + variants + images, or cart + items + totals) in one round-trip
- Cursor-based pagination
- Typed schema with introspection

GraphQL suits modern frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and React Native. See the [GraphQL API Guide](/api/graphql-api/introduction) to get started.

## REST API

The Bagisto REST API follows RESTful principles and provides complete access across all Bagisto features. Perfect for:

- **Mobile Applications** - Build native iOS/Android shopping apps
- **Third-party Integrations** - Connect with external systems and services
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)** - Create fast, app-like web experiences
- **Custom Admin Interfaces** - Build specialized admin tools

**What sets it apart:**
- Standard HTTP verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) and status codes
- One resource per URL — predictable and easy to cache
- Works with any HTTP client — no query language to learn
- Header-based pagination (`X-Total-Count`, `X-Page`, `X-Per-Page`, `X-Total-Pages`)
- Interactive "try it" documentation

## Build with AI

These docs are built for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity) as much as for humans. A machine-readable [`llms.txt`](/llms.txt) indexes every endpoint, so an agent can discover the whole API surface in one fetch. Point your agent at **[Build with AI](/api/build-with-ai/)** — the hub that ties together every AI resource (`llms.txt`, agent skills, and the MCP server). Two ways to make an assistant productive on Bagisto:

### Agent Skills

Installable build-rules that teach an agent the storefront flows, the auth model, and the transport gotchas (`token` vs `apiToken`, `id` vs `_id`, filter and sort shapes) up front — so it writes correct calls instead of rediscovering them each session. Install once with `npx skills add bagisto/agent-skills`. See [Agent Skills](/api/build-with-ai/agent-skills).

### MCP Server

An optional local server that lets an agent search these docs on demand from inside the editor — it pulls the exact request and response for an endpoint mid-task instead of guessing. Runs on your machine, indexes the latest published docs. See [MCP Server](/api/build-with-ai/mcp-server).

## Workflows

Individual endpoint pages document one call; the [Workflows](/api/workflows/) show how to **chain** them into a real task — browse & filter catalog, cart, checkout, customer account, returns, and more — each with a dependency diagram and an ordered call table. Start here (agent or human) when building an end-to-end flow rather than a single request.
