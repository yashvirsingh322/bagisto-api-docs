# Delete Event

Deletes a marketing event — the **Delete** row action on the admin **Marketing →
Communications → Events** screen.

New here? Read the [Events overview](/api/rest-api/admin/marketing/communications/events/) for what an event does and how its fields behave.

## Endpoint

| Endpoint | Method |
|----------|--------|
| `/api/admin/marketing/events/{id}` | DELETE |

## Details

- Requires an admin Bearer token and the `marketing.communications.events.delete`
  permission.
- Returns a success message on completion.
- An event a campaign is scheduled against cannot be deleted — it comes back as a `400`, since removing it would leave that campaign with nothing to fire on. Point the campaign at another event first.
- An unknown id returns a `404`.
