# Delete Email Template

Deletes an email template — the **Delete** row action on the admin **Marketing →
Communications → Email Templates** screen.

New here? Read the [Email Templates overview](/api/rest-api/admin/marketing/communications/templates/) for what a template does and how its fields behave.

## Endpoint

| Endpoint | Method |
|----------|--------|
| `/api/admin/marketing/templates/{id}` | DELETE |

## Details

- Requires an admin Bearer token and the `marketing.communications.email_templates.delete`
  permission.
- Returns a success message on completion.
- A template a campaign still sends cannot be deleted — it comes back as a `400`, since removing it would leave that campaign with nothing to send. Point the campaign at another template first.
- An unknown id returns a `404`.
