# Update Sitemap

Updates an existing sitemap — the **Edit Sitemap** action on the admin
**Marketing → Search & SEO → Sitemaps** screen.

New here? Read the [Sitemaps overview](/api/rest-api/admin/marketing/search-seo/sitemaps/) for what a sitemap does and how its fields behave.

## Endpoint

| Endpoint | Method |
|----------|--------|
| `/api/admin/marketing/sitemaps/{id}` | PUT |

## Details

- Requires an admin Bearer token and the `marketing.search_seo.sitemaps.edit`
  permission.
- The update is a **partial merge** — send only the fields you want to change;
  omitted fields keep their existing values.
- Returns the full updated sitemap payload.

### Channels are replaced, not merged

Sending `channels` sets the sitemap's channels to exactly that list, so include
every channel it should cover. Leaving it out keeps the current ones, which is
what makes renaming a file safe.

### No auto-regeneration

Changing `file_name` / `path` does not rebuild the XML. Call
[generate](/api/rest-api/admin/marketing/search-seo/sitemaps-generate)
(`POST /api/admin/marketing/sitemaps/{id}/generate`) to refresh the files.

## Request body

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `file_name` | string | no | Index file name — letters, digits, `-`, `_`, `.`; must end with `.xml` |
| `path` | string | no | Where the index file is written — must start and end with `/`, no `//` |
| `channels` | integer[] | no | Channel ids the sitemap covers. The list you send **replaces** the current one; omit it to keep the channels the sitemap already covers |
