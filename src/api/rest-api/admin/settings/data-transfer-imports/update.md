# Update Import

| Endpoint | Method |
|----------|--------|
| `/api/admin/settings/data-transfer/imports/{id}` | PUT |

Re-saves an import's configuration. The import is reset back to `pending` and any earlier processing counts and error report are cleared. The `{id}` is the import id.

Send the request as `multipart/form-data`. The `file` field is optional — when a new file is sent it replaces the previous source file; when omitted the existing file is kept.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | yes | The importer to use, e.g. `products`, `customers`, `tax_rates`. |
| `action` | yes | `append` or `delete`. |
| `validation_strategy` | yes | `stop-on-errors` or `skip-errors`. |
| `allowed_errors` | yes | Integer `≥ 0`. |
| `field_separator` | yes | The column delimiter, e.g. `,`. |
| `process_in_queue` | no | When `true`, large imports are processed asynchronously. |
| `image_source` | no | Where a product import reads the images its rows name: `directory`, `upload` or `url`. |
| `upload_images` | with `upload` | A ZIP of the images, up to 100 MB. A replacement archive starts from an empty folder, so an image dropped from it stops being matched. Not required if one has already been uploaded for this import. |
| `images_directory_path` | with `directory` | Folder under `storage/app/import` holding the images. |
| `file` | no | A replacement import file (`csv`, `xls`, `xlsx`, or `xml`). |

Returns the updated import detail.

Permission: `settings.data_transfer.imports.edit`.
