# Get Customer Downloadable Products

Retrieve all downloadable product purchases belonging to the authenticated customer. This is a **read-only** API — customers can view their purchased downloadable links, check download status, and see remaining downloads.

## Endpoint

```
GET /api/shop/customer-downloadable-products
```

## Request Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Description |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Yes | Request content type |
| `X-STOREFRONT-KEY` | `pk_storefront_xxx` | Yes | Storefront API key |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer {token}` | Yes | Customer authentication token |

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | Integer | Downloadable link purchase ID |
| `productName` | String | Name of the purchased product |
| `name` | String | Name of the downloadable link |
| `url` | String\|null | External download URL (for URL-type links) |
| `file` | String\|null | File path (for file-type links) |
| `fileName` | String | Display name of the file |
| `type` | String | Link type: `file` or `url` |
| `downloadBought` | Integer | Total number of allowed downloads |
| `downloadUsed` | Integer | Number of times downloaded |
| `downloadCanceled` | Integer | Number of canceled downloads |
| `status` | String | Purchase status: `available`, `expired`, or `pending` |
| `remainingDownloads` | Integer | Computed remaining downloads (`null` if unlimited) |
| `customerId` | Integer | ID of the customer who purchased |
| `orderId` | Integer | Associated order ID |
| `orderItemId` | Integer | Associated order item ID |
| `order` | Object | Associated order details |
| `createdAt` | DateTime | Purchase creation date |
| `updatedAt` | DateTime | Purchase last update date |

### Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `available` | Download link is active and can be used |
| `pending` | Order has not been invoiced yet; download is not available |
| `expired` | All downloads have been used or the link has expired |

## cURL Example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api-demo.bagisto.com/api/shop/customer-downloadable-products" \
  -H "X-STOREFRONT-KEY: pk_storefront_your_key_here" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CUSTOMER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Empty Collection

When the customer has no downloadable product purchases:

```json
[]
```

## Notes

- **Read-only API:** Only `GET` operations are available.
- **Customer isolation:** Purchases are automatically filtered by the authenticated customer. A customer can never see another customer's purchases.
- **Field naming:** REST responses use camelCase field names (e.g., `productName`, `downloadBought`, `remainingDownloads`).
- **Computed field:** `remainingDownloads` is calculated as `downloadBought - downloadUsed - downloadCanceled`. Returns `null` for unlimited downloads.
