## Notes

- **Separate route:** The `/pdf` endpoint is a separate route (not an API Platform operation).
- **Rendering engine:** Uses DomPDF for LTR locales and mPDF for RTL locales, supporting multilingual invoice rendering.
- **Customer isolation:** Customers can only download PDFs for invoices from their own orders.
- **Binary response:** The response body is a raw PDF binary stream, not JSON.

## Use Cases

- Allow customers to download invoice PDFs for their records
- Provide printable invoice documents
- Support accounting and tax filing workflows
